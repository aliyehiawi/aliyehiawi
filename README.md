Software Engineer specialized in backend systems and data engineering, currently working as a Data Engineer at **Wiremind (Cargo team)**.

I work on industrializing data pipelines and machine learning components powering air cargo forecasting, overbooking strategies, and revenue optimization. My role covers the full data value chain: ingesting and validating operational airline data, transforming and structuring it in production-grade warehouses, deploying forecasting and optimization processes, and continuously improving reliability, performance, and observability.

My daily stack revolves around Python (FastAPI, asynchronous processing, SQLAlchemy), PostgreSQL, Redis, and production data workflows. I focus strongly on clean architecture, modular design, testing, CI/CD, monitoring, and reducing technical debt. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data engineering, MLOps, and scalable backend systems.

Previously, I worked extensively with Java and Spring Boot, designing secure APIs, distributed systems, and enterprise-grade backend applications. I care deeply about code quality, robustness, and building systems that remain maintainable under real-world production constraints.

I approach engineering with a product mindset: understanding business constraints, clarifying ambiguity, and delivering pragmatic, reliable solutions.
